## Introduction

The idea of self-hosting an email server had never really occurred to me as a possibility before.
It always seemed like one of those things that someone else should take care of
and that I would just set myself up for a world of hurt if I tried to do it myself.
But like the good old saying goes - if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself.

I guess there's no single thing that I can point to and say *"this is the reason why I want to self-host my own email server"*.
Rather, it's a combination of a general interest in technology, increased privacy
concerns with email service providers and/or limitations of limitations within their products.

I've been a customer with Proton Mail for some time now, and I have been quite pleased with the service.
It's privacy focused (at least they claim it is, mkay) and works well for sending and receiving emails.
However, when it comes to features, it leaves a little something to be desired.
For instance, on the **Unlimited** plan for 12,99√¢‚Äö¬¨/month you get to use 3 custom domains and a total of 15 aliases.
The 15 aliases are enough for most people, but problems arise when you want to have separation between the aliases and your account.
The alises are configured to be able to be used to log into your account with the *"master"* password.
What if I want to set up aliases to use for account separation on other services I use?

In this case I want aliases that are either configured to not be able to log in OR inboxes separated from my main email inbox all together.
Proton makes it quite easy to set up new email accounts, which are separate from your main inbox, but as of the day I'm writing this there
is no way to actually forward all incoming email from that address to your main inbox. Cool üëç

Also, I'm not interested in having a whole suite of apps at my disposal when I pay for an email service.
I actually just want a solid ***email*** expeience.

So then, let's get into it!

## Prerequisits

For setting up our self hosted mail server, we're going to need:
1) a VPS
2) a domain name

Then we need to decide on how we want to set up the mail server. Do we want to
go full manual, balls to the wall, lord take the wheel way where we install and
configure everything by ourselves? Or do we want to use a pre-packaged solution
to make this process just a little bit less miserable?

For me, I'll go with a pre-packaged solution called _*Mail-in-a-Box*_.

The VPS provider I'm going to be using is _*Linode*_. They actually have a very nice
and handy guide available on their website for us to follow. However, I'm going
to be setting up multiple domains on the same instance of Mail-in-a-Box.
